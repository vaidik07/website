# Travel website

Brief description 


Our project provides a platform to connect transport and hotel  services to their desired customers using essential web development. Our website first requests 
the user to log in to the website and store the user data like name, password, email id, and further details in the database. After the login page, the main 
website is displayed.
Then the program asks the user the destination he/she wants to visit then it asks the date, time, and duration of the travel.

According to the above data, the budget is displayed by using basic javascript which includes all the expenses such as flight fare, hotel cost, etc. Then the 
user will click on the submit button. After clicking the submit button all the user's data will be stored in the company's database.
